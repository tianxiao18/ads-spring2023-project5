+ Project summary: This study aims to develop a regional human flow prediction model with enhanced generalization capabilities and environmental adaptability using 90 weeks of data from New York City, which covers five features for 172 zip code areas (regional population, median regional income, COVID-19 incidence rate, POI, and regional human flow). To achieve this, we compare some typical time series model such as AR, HA, LSTM and so on with Attention Spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Neural Network [(ASTGCN)](https://github.com/wanhuaiyu/ASTGCN) to effectively predict regional visitation volume. 
	

**Contribution statement**: [Xinming Pan] Coding about the structure of ASTGCN model, and make a comparison with the baseline models. [Hetian Xiao]
